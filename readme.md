# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Full Stack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from No Stack all the way to a Full Stack Developer. This repository will have almost everything I did during the `second module`, or `M2` for short.<br />

<hr />

The `S` stands for `SPRINT` <strong>e.g.</strong> `S1` means `SPRINT 1`.<br />
The numbers are the activity numbers. Every activity has a name and a number.<br />
The `M` stands for `Modules` <strong>e.g.</strong> `M2` means `Module 2`. That's how the bootcamp curriculum is separated.<br />
→ All the activities and projects have their own readme files with instructions inside their respective folders.

## S1-14-M2 - 01/27/23 - SITE INSTITUCIONAL GENÉRICO

## S2-12-M2 - 02/03/23 - RECRIANDO MÉTODOS DE ARRAY
For my next activity I had to solve exercises using JavaScript, avoiding the use of methods. The exercises had to pass a Unit Testing using Jest. All of the code but the script.js was already done.<br />
→ <b>Please run the unit test to see the results</b><br />

## S3-03-M2 - 02/06/23 - CRIANDO MENU RESPONSIVO
For my next activity I had to code a Responsive Menu based on an example given from Figma using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The menu vanishes when the screen gets smaller and a button appears. When pressed it shows the items that were previously hidden.<br />

## S3-12-M2 - 02/10/23 - REDE SOCIAL
For my next activity I had to code a Social Media Web Site based on an example given from Figma using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The web site had to have an input for the post title, another for the post content and a button to submit your post. This post had to show on top of other posts made by other people. I also had to code a working follow button for the people in the suggestions and a working like button on every post. On top of all that the web site had to be responsive, and most importantly, mobile first.<br />

## S4-14-M2 - 02/17/23 - GIT SEARCH
For my next activity I had to code a GitHub User Search Website based on an example given from Figma using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website uses the GitHub API to search for users on GitHub. If a user doesn't exist the website redirects you to an error page with a button to go back to the home page where you can try again. If the user is found the website redirects you to a profile page where you can see the user's picture, name and public repositories available. It also has a button to take you to a specific repository.<br />

## S5-14-M2 - 03/20/23 - POKÉDEX
For this extra activity I had to code a Pokédex using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I grew up watching the show and playing the games and I knew I had to do something different and special. A simple list wouldn't do it justice. You can browse between over a thousand Pokémon using the side arrows. All Pokémon from all generations are included (depends on the API). You can select a Pokémon from the list or use the search bar to find a specific Pokémon. When you select the Pokémon you want, the Pokédex will show its name, Pokédex number, height, weight, picture and a brief description (depends on the API).<br />

## S6-17-M2 - 03/03/23 - PETINFO
For my next activity I had to code a Social Media Page for pet owners based on an example given from Figma using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website uses the Petinfo API which only runs locally. It has a sign in and sign up page, getting the info from the API. When logged in you can see other people's posts and make your own as well. You can also edit and delete your own posts. When you're done you can log out using the dropdown menu.<br />
→ <b>This project uses an API that has to be open locally to work, you can find the API inside the back-end folder.</b><br />

## S7-01-M2 - 03/03/23 - KENZIE EMPRESAS
For the module's final project I had to code an HR Management Application based on an example given from Figma using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website uses an API which only runs locally. It has a sign in page, a sign up page and two dashboards, one for the admin and one for regular users. On the regular user page you can edit your information like name, email and password. You can also see who works in your department. On the admin page you can create departments, you can hire and fire employees, you can see all users who are registered in the system, and more. This is a mobile first website.<br />
