# BOOTCAMP PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES
I'll be posting here all the activities and projects I had to code during my Full Stack bootcamp at Kenzie Academy so I can show my progress from No Stack all the way to a Full Stack Developer. This repository will have almost everything I did during the `second module`, or `M2` for short.<br />

<hr />

The `S` stands for `SPRINT` <strong>e.g.</strong> `S1` means `SPRINT 1`.<br />
The numbers are the activity numbers. Every activity has a name and a number.<br />
The `M` stands for `Modules` <strong>e.g.</strong> `M2` means `Module 2`. That's how the bootcamp curriculum is separated.<br />
→ All the activities and projects have their own readme files with instructions inside their respective folders.

The web site had to have an input for the post title, another for the post content and a button to submit your post. This post had to show on top of other posts made by other people. I also had to code a working follow button for the people in the suggestions and a working like button on every post. On top of all that the web site had to be responsive, and most importantly, mobile first.<br />
<br />
`scaffolding` `dialog` `input` `css variables` `flexbox` `backdrop` `overflow` `media query` `function` `variables` `data type` `boolean` `conditionals` `arrays` `methods` `es module` `objects` `DOM` `+`

For my next activity I had to code a GitHub User Search Website based on an example given from Figma using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website uses the GitHub API to search for users on GitHub. If a user doesn't exist the website redirects you to an error page with a button to go back to the home page where you can try again. If the user is found the website redirects you to a profile page where you can see the user's picture, name and public repositories available. It also has a button to take you to a specific repository.<br />
<br />
`scaffolding` `css variables` `flexbox` `function` `variables` `data type` `boolean` `conditionals` `methods` `DOM` `JSON` `local storage` `API` `+`

## S5-04-M2 - 02/23/23 - "[GET, POST, PATCH E DELETE](https://bitoller.github.io/BOOTCAMP-PROJECTS-AND-ACTIVITIES-M2/src/M2-SPRINT-5/S5-04-M2/front-end/index.html)"
Waiting for the API to be fixed.

## S5-07-M2 - 02/24/23 - "[MANIPULANDO TOKEN](https://bitoller.github.io/BOOTCAMP-PROJECTS-AND-ACTIVITIES-M2/src/M2-SPRINT-5/S5-07-M2/index.html)"
Waiting for the API to be fixed.

## S6-17-M2 - 03/03/23 - "[PETINFO](https://bitoller.github.io/BOOTCAMP-PROJECTS-AND-ACTIVITIES-M2/src/M2-SPRINT-6/S6-17-M2/front-end/index.html)"
For my next activity I had to code a Social Media Page for pet owners based on an example given from Figma using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website uses the Petinfo API which only runs locally. It has a log in and sign up page, getting the info from the API. When logged in you can see other people's posts and make your own as well. You can also edit and delete your own posts. When you're done you can log out using the dropdown menu.<br />
→ <b>This project uses an API that has to be open locally to work, you can find the API inside the back-end folder.</b><br />
<br />
`scaffolding` `input` `dialog` `snackbar` `css variables` `flexbox` `hover` `focus` `backdrop` `function` `variables` `data type` `boolean` `conditionals` `objects` `methods` `es module` `DOM` `JSON` `local storage` `token` `API` `+`

## S7-01-M2 - 03/03/23 - "[EMPRESAS](https://bitoller.github.io/BOOTCAMP-PROJECTS-AND-ACTIVITIES-M2/src/M2-SPRINT-7/S7-01-M2/front-end/home.html)"
The project is done but I still need to fix the file paths for it to work here.
